My name is Jo√£o Diogo Duarte and I am a PhD Cryptography Student at the University of Porto and INESC-TEC under the supervision of Professor Manuel Barbosa.In my work, I enjoy demonstrating security of post-quantum schemes and researching post-quantum migration of systems through the design, security proofs, verification and validation of high-assurance implementations and specifications of PQC and hybrid protocols.
